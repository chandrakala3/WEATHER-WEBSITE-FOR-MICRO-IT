DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT :
ðŸ“Œ Project: Weather App / Website
ðŸŽ¯ Description:
The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches data from a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) and displays key details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Users enter a city name, and the app retrieves and presents weather data in a clean, responsive interface. Additional features may include weather icons, background changes based on weather type, error messages for invalid input, and current date/time display.

This project helps beginners understand core web development concepts such as API integration, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/async-await). It enhances front-end skills while solving a real-world use case.
